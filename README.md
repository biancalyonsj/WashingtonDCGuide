# WashingtonDCGuide
<b> A multi-screen app that displays a list of Museums, Memorials, Government Buildings, and Restaurants in Washington DC. </b> 

<p> Project #5 for the <b>Android Basics Nanodegree</b> by Google </p>

<p> This app focuses on combining various concepts in order to build a multi-screen app. I learned how Android handles touch events and 
how to use explicit intents to link between activities. Each screen contains a list of attractions in DC. I used a ViewPager plus 
TabLayout to navigate between lists in Fragments. I also used a custom adapter to populate the layouts with views based on instances 
of the custom class. </p>

Core Concepts I learned Completing this Project:
----------------------------------------------
-	Creating new activities
-	Using explicit Intents to link between activities
-	Using OnClickListeners to add behavior to buttons using Java code
-	Creating my own Custom Class
-	Looping through an ArrayList
-	Populating a ListView with an ArrayAdapter
-	Selecting proper data structs to store lists of information
-	Building layouts to display those lists of data
-	Navigating between lists in Fragments using a ViewPager plus TabLayout
-	Properly handling images
